# YouTube-Videos-Trend-Analysis
Exploring YouTube Trends with Data Analysis 
mini-project where I dove into a dataset of trending YouTube videos to uncover insights and trends. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Key Highlights:
Handled missing data effectively to ensure robust analysis.
Visualized the distribution of video views, revealing interesting patterns in user engagement.
Analyzed the correlation between various metrics like views, likes, and comments, using heatmaps to illustrate relationships.
Explored how video categories impact view counts through box plots.
This project enhanced my skills in Python, data visualization (using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn), and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
